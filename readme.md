I will be adapting the code for rock scissors paper to work in this environment.

In addition to the normal fuctions, I want to do the following.

- Instead of a "prompt" menu, the player will click which option they want.
- After clicking their option, their option's picture (card) should appear in the "player choice" box.
- The computer's choice should also appear in the "computer choice" box.
- A message should be displayed on screen to indicate who lost/won.
- A score counter should be present.
- When five rounds are completed, a prompt message should appear indicating who won.
    It should also ask if the player wants to play again.
- If the player selects 'yes', a function should run to reset all counters and allow for another game of play.
- If the player selects "cancel", replace the screen with a "Thanks for Playing Screen".
